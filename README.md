# Meme Scraper

The Task was to create a cli (Command Line Interface) application that scrapes this website:

https://memegen-link-examples-upleveled.netlify.app/

...and saves the first 10 images into a folder called "memes" within the directory of the new project.

A task was also to avoid using a "image scraper" library that does everything for you - try to break it down into smaller steps and then you can choose libraries for the smaller things.

I made sure that the meme images are "ignored" from GitHub - they don't show up in the repository.
